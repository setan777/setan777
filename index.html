Lyrics by Ade Bintang
[00:00.80]I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
[00:03.84]When we're alone
[00:06.00]You can hold my hand
[00:08.10]If no one's home
[00:10.00]Do you like it when I'm away?
[00:13.50]If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?

[00:17.50]I can feel all my bones coming back
[00:20.50]And I'm craving motion
[00:23.00]Mama never really learns how to live by herself
[00:26.50]It's a curse
[00:28.50]I And it's growing

[00:30.10]You're a pond and I'm an ocean
[00:34.00]Oh, all my emotions
[00:39.50]Feel like explosions when you are around
[00:45.00]And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh
[00:51.50]I Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
[00:56.50]I need you here to stay
[01:00.00]I broke all my bones that day I found you
[01:05.00]Crying at the lake
[01:08.30]Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
[01:14.50]I Oh, and if I could take it all back

[01:18.10]I swear that I would pull you from the tide
[01:29.50]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
[01:29.50]I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
[01:29.50]Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
I And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh at last, it is past
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?" Oh
Guess there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
